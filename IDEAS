output
	raw list available on the machine as a file
		since the default file storage is in /tmp, no stale data remains
		switch to a domain socket?
			requires either socat or 'clarissa cat'
				socat's not guaranteed to be available
					clarissa is
						por que no los dos?
					'cat' should be part of the main binary
			more requests == more dead time
				fork() on request, die after replying
			a domain socket could easily be exposed over the network?
			would lose the potential to allow resumption (unless the file output is kept)
				can still preload a previous output
				and optionally output to a file on exit
		separate program translates list and makes available on LAN?
			clar_count.sh makes translation available on the machine
			output to mqtt?
				can't be integrated because of topic?
				separate script or just crontab oneliner with mosquitto_pub
					does run clar_count.sh twice...

preload
	if output is persistent and includes the IP address, load
	else scan the subnet?

multithreading to increase capacity?

bitcmp()
	allow starting at an offset
		for example: check 10 bits at byte pointer with a 2 bit offset
		(* = byte aligned pointers; . = area boundries; 1 = mask)
			* .     *  .
