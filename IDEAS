output
	raw list available on the machine as a socket
		accessible via `clarissa cat` or socat [mysterious incantation]
			this is part of the clarissa binary as to always be available
			more requests == more dead time
				fork() on request, die after replying
			a domain socket could easily be exposed over the network?
		and optionally output to a file on exit (--will)
		separate program translates list and makes available on LAN?
			these are currently in the utils branch

bitcmp()
	allow starting at an offset
		for example: check 10 bits at byte pointer with a 2 bit offset
		(* = byte aligned pointers; . = area boundries; 1 = mask)
			* .     *  .
