output
	raw list available on the machine as a file
		include IPs to allow resumption?
		switch to a domain socket?
			requires either socat or "clarissa state"
				socat's not guaranteed to be available
					clarissa is
						por que no los dos?
			since the default file storage is in /tmp, it shouldn't be kept (no privacy issue)
			a domain socket could easily be exposed over the network?
			would lose the potential to allow resumption (unless the file output is kept)
		separate program translates list and makes available on LAN?
			clar_count.sh makes translation available on the machine
			output to mqtt?
				can't be integrated because of topic?
				separate script or just crontab oneliner with mosquitto_pub
					does run clar_count.sh twice...
			use the OUI registry?

preload
	if output is persistent and includes the IP address, load
	else scan the subnet?

multithreading to increase capacity?

bitcmp()
	allow starting at an offset
		for example: check 10 bits at byte pointer with a 2 bit offset
		(* = byte aligned pointers; . = area boundries; 1 = mask)
			* .     *  .
