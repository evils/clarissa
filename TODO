implement nag()
	fill in Host data
implement subnet_check()
add LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL support
accept multiple devices
accept multiple subnets (at least IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously)
add long options and a usage message
output on a socket

IDEAS:
add exponential delay to timeout per node
	reduce nagging on less frequent devices

ISSUES:
because of separated functions, it nags right before culling
	currently separated to not have 6 arguments to a function
		interval can help with this
