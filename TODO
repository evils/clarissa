packaging
	daemonizing
		figure out dealing with multiple instances
			different options for each
			and a better output location?
				/tmp is a security issue?
		procd for openwrt
			started
		systemd for everything else?
			figure out how to avoid the "any" and "lo" devices being picked
				current approach
					require network-online.target (no "any")
					fail on "lo", 1s restart timer, 10 tries
			nix
				started
			debian
				works from Makefile now

tests
	get_addrss()
		assemble a publishable pcap file

docs
	document output
		maybe after the domain socket thing?

output
	switch to domain socket
		on read, fork, dump out the list, die
		where to put this?

code
	support "any" device (linux cooked capture)
		receiving done, can't send packets
		save interface for each entry, get Host struct for each interface, respond appropriately?
			a lot of overhead?

	separately save and output the IPv4 address
		make sure the most recent [IPv4|IPv6] entry gets used to nag?

CLAR_COUNT.SH:

	make sure log() doesn't lose data
	find a place for macs.csv
