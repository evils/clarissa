confirm ARP packets' frames leave with a CRC

output (see IDEAS)

implement nag()'s IPv6 support
implement get_ipv6()

accept multiple devices
	add LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL support
	requires nag() support for non-ethernet frames?

accept multiple subnets (at least IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously)
	see IDEAS

add long options


IDEAS:

output
	raw list available on the machine?
		domain socket?
		separate program translates list and makes available on LAN?
			translate to (names/vendors) and/or a tally per type?
			output to mqtt?

in the absence of a given subnet, use host struct's IP's subnet?
	would prefer not to send ARP/NDP to non-subnet IPs
		ARP packets don't pass the router (it responds for its MAC)
			NDP?
			still an issue if clarissa runs on a router

add "preload" initial scan?

add exponential delay to timeout per node
	reduce nagging on less frequent devices
		longer dropout time

multithreading to increase capacity?
