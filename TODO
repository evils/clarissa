code
	output
		switch to domain socket
			on read, fork, dump out the list, die
			where to put this?
				/run is preferred by FHS 3.0
				/var/run works for freebsd
					and is guaranteed to exist by FHS 3.0
					both mention memory-backed storage
				/var/run/clar/enp5s0_192.168.0.0-16

	reconsider options
		make capitalization more consistent?
		add redundant options?
		separate flags and options?
		separate setup and algorithm options?

packaging
	daemonizing
		figure out dealing with multiple instances
			different options for each
		procd for openwrt
			started
		systemd for everything else?
			figure out how to avoid the "any" and "lo" devices being picked
				current approach
					require network-online.target (no "any")
					fail on "lo", 1s restart timer, 10 tries
			nix
				started
			debian
				works from Makefile now

tests
	get_addrss()
		assemble a publishable pcap file

docs
	document output
		maybe after the domain socket thing?

CLAR_COUNT
		make sure log() doesn't lose data
		find a place for macs.csv
