fix subnet_check()

confirm ARP packets' frames leave with a CRC

output (see multithreading)

in the absence of a subnet, use host struct?
	would prefer not to send ARP/NDP to non-subnet IPs

implement get_ipv6()
implement nag()'s IPv6 support?

add "preload" initial scan?

accept multiple devices
	add LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL support
	requires nag() support for non-ethernet frames?

accept multiple subnets (at least IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously)

add long options

multithreading?
	generate a count based on a known MAC addresses reference?
		output count to mqtt?
	output MAC addresses on a socket?

IDEAS:
add exponential delay to timeout per node
	reduce nagging on less frequent devices
