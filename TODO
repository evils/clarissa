code
	abstract setup of socket and output file directories
	implement --preload (load will file)
	add stats subcommand
		catch SIGUSR1 and pcap_stat?
			is SIGUSR1 portable?
		do iproute2 style subcommand substring matching?

packaging
	daemonizing
		figure out dealing with multiple instances
			managing different options for each
			multiple instances can be started manually
		procd for openwrt
			started
		systemd for everything else?
			prefer $RUNTIME_DIRECTORY and/or $STATE_DIRECTORY if available?
				currently hard-coded defaults to /var/{run,lib}/clar
				unit can pass in -o $STATE_DIRECTORY or -s $RUNTIME_DIRECTORY
			wants time-sync.target?
			add capabilities?

			figure out how to avoid the "any" and "lo" devices being picked
				current approach
					require network-online.target (no "any")
					fail on "lo", 1s restart timer, 10 tries
			nix
				started
			debian
				works from Makefile now

tests
	end-end test
		assemble a publishable pcap file
		--will option may help with this

docs
