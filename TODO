code
	reconsider options
		make capitalization more consistent?
		add redundant options?
		separate flags and options?
		separate setup and algorithm options?
	consider preload option (load will file)

	cat
		default to first item in /var/run/clar?
		allow `clar cat /var/run/clar/*`

packaging
	daemonizing
		figure out dealing with multiple instances
			managing different options for each
			multiple instances can be started manually
		procd for openwrt
			started
		systemd for everything else?
			figure out how to avoid the "any" and "lo" devices being picked
				current approach
					require network-online.target (no "any")
					fail on "lo", 1s restart timer, 10 tries
			nix
				started
			debian
				works from Makefile now

tests
	get_addrss()
		assemble a publishable pcap file
		--will option may help with this

docs
	write an unambiguous specification of the output line format
	(re)write man pages in asciidoc(ter)
		for commands and functions
