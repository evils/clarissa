implement subnet_check()
	use host struct?
implement nag()
implement get_ipv6()
add LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL support
accept multiple devices
accept multiple subnets (at least IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously)
add long options
multithreading
	generate a count based on a known MAC addresses reference?
		output count to mqtt?
	output MAC addresses on a socket?

IDEAS:
add exponential delay to timeout per node
	reduce nagging on less frequent devices
