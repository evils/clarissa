code
	output
		switch to domain socket
			on read, fork, dump out the list, die
			where to put this?

	support "any" device (linux cooked capture)
		receiving done, can't send packets
		save interface for each entry, get Host struct for each interface, respond appropriately?
			a lot of overhead?
		separate listen and send interface +1

	add way to separate listening and sending interface

packaging
	daemonizing
		figure out dealing with multiple instances
			different options for each
			and a better output location?
				/tmp is a security issue?
		procd for openwrt
			started
		systemd for everything else?
			figure out how to avoid the "any" and "lo" devices being picked
				current approach
					require network-online.target (no "any")
					fail on "lo", 1s restart timer, 10 tries
			nix
				started
			debian
				works from Makefile now

tests
	get_addrss()
		assemble a publishable pcap file

docs
	document output
		maybe after the domain socket thing?


tools

	show
		add reverse DNS lookup

	count
		make sure log() doesn't lose data
