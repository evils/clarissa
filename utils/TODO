clar
	handle OUI file discovery
		$PWD:$HOME/local/share/clar:/share/clar

	show
		handle multiple file input?
			probably better to just run show on each file
				put the used input in the output header?
			accept STDIN to E.G.: 'clar cat /tmp/clar_* | clar show'

	count
		make sure log() doesn't lose data
		find a place for macs.csv?

		log needs a portable sha256sum
			ship source for such?
				reuse it for OUI_assemble.sh?

OUI_assemble.sh
	CSV handling with awk is flawed
	make my own repo with versioned tab separated files from IEEE?
		and a pre-made trimmed file?
		need to figure out how to set up reliable automation for that

packaging
	clarissa binary goes in /bin
	utils go in /usr/lib
		no, united in 1 file in /bin
			solves sub-script discovery problem
