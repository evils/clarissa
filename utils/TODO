clar show
	handle multiple file input?
		probably better to just run show on each file
			put the used input in the output header?
		accept STDIN to E.G.: 'clar cat /tmp/clar_* | clar show'

clar count
	make sure log() doesn't lose data
	find a place for macs.csv?

OUI_assemble.sh
	CSV handling with awk is flawed
	make my own repo with versioned tab separated files from IEEE?
		and a pre-made trimmed file?
		need to figure out how to set up reliable automation for that

packaging
	utils go in /usr/lib
	clarissa binary goes in /bin
	/bin/clar -> usr/lib/clar.sh
